# WinShell

## About

WinShell is my first real Vue 3 project. It's a windows shell interface.

> Currently, only the frontend is implemented; backend functionality is not complete. The project is primarily used for testing GitHub Actions and learning Vue 3 best practices.

## Features

- Responsive hover and click interactions
- Custom components for controls, notifications, and popups
- Glassmorphism-inspired UI with smooth transitions

## Next Steps

- Fully implement backend logic and interactivity
- Refactor to take full advantage of Vue 3 reactivity and composition API
- Add tests and improve accessibility

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- TypeScript
- CSS / TailwindCSS
- GitHub Actions for CI / testing

## Info

This project is primarily experimental.
